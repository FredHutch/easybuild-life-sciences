It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s   of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes.   Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome,   its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes. - Homepage: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml "
