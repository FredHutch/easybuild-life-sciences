TeX is a typesetting language. Instead of visually
formatting your text, you enter your manuscript text intertwined with TeX
commands in a plain text file. You then run TeX to produce formatted output,
such as a PDF file. Thus, in contrast to standard word processors, your
document is a separate file that does not pretend to be a representation
of the final typeset output, and so can be easily edited and manipulated.

applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native
API rather than emulating the GUI.
