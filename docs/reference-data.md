## Reference Data 

Reference data used by modules.

### Ensemble Data

For applications that require Ensemble data.  (Cache data used by VEP.)
```
/shared/biodata/ngs/Reference/Genomes/Homo_sapiens/Ensembl-110
```

### 10X Genomics
The Hutch has serveral packages from 10X Genomoics. 
 - Cell Ranger
 - Cellranger ATAC 
 - Cell Ranger ARC
 - Space Ranger
Refernce data for 10X Genomics tools is located
```
/shared/biodata/ngs/Reference/10X`
```

### Kraken2
Kraken 2 is the newest version of Kraken, a taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast classification speeds. This classifier matches each k-mer within a query sequence to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing the given k-mer. The k-mer assignments inform the classification algorithm.

### STAR2
[STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) aligns RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using uncompressed suffix arrays.
Modules: `STAR/2.7.10b-GCC-12.2.0`

### AlphaFold

AlphaFold is an AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence.

### CHOPCHOP
CHOPCHOP (version 3) is a tool for selecting target sites for CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cpf1, CRISPR/Cas13 or NICKASE/TALEN-directed mutagenesis.

### tcrdist3

tcrdist3 is an open-source python package that enables a broad array of T cell receptor sequence analyses.
There are many other applications for analyzing TCR data; DeepTCR, clusTCR, [pubtcrs](https://github.com/phbradley/pubtcrs).
