[easyconfig](https://github.com/FredHutch/easybuild-life-sciences/blob/master/fh_easyconfigs/h/HMMER/HMMER-3.2.1-foss-2018b.eb)
HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs
 of protein sequences, and for making protein sequence alignments. It
 implements methods using probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov
 models (profile HMMs).  Compared to BLAST, FASTA, and other sequence
 alignment and database search tools based on older scoring methodology,
 HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and more able to detect remote
 homologs because of the strength of its underlying mathematical models. In the
 past, this strength came at significant computational expense, but in the new
 HMMER3 project, HMMER is now essentially as fast as BLAST.

IDBA-UD is a iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads
 Sequencing data with Highly Uneven Sequencing Depth. It is an extension of IDBA algorithm.
 IDBA-UD also iterates from small k to a large k. In each iteration, short and low-depth
 contigs are removed iteratively with cutoff threshold from low to high to reduce the errors
 in low-depth and high-depth regions. Paired-end reads are aligned to contigs and assembled
 locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions. With these technologies, IDBA-UD
 can iterate k value of de Bruijn graph to a very large value with less gaps and less branches
 to form long contigs in both low-depth and high-depth regions.

Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technology that can reveal a lot about what happens in a group of cells as they develop. But because the technology destroys a cell, it can only provide snapshots of the cells in a group at one point in time. To really understand how cells develop over time, snapshots aren't good enough: scientists want to fill in the gaps between snapshots and string everything together into a movie.
