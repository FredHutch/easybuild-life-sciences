 - [BCFtools/1.9-foss-2018b](http://www.htslib.org/)  Samtools is a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data.
 BCFtools
 - [BEDTools/2.27.1-foss-2018b](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2)  The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as finding feature overlaps
 and computing coverage. The utilities are largely based on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF,
 and SAM/BAM.
 - [BamTools/2.5.1-foss-2018b](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools)  BamTools provides both a programmer's API and an end-user's toolkit for handling BAM files.
 - [Bowtie2/2.3.4.2-foss-2018b](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)  Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads
 to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s
 of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes.
 Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome,
 its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.
 - [GEOS/3.6.2-foss-2018b-Python-3.6.6](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos)  GEOS (Geometry Engine
 - [GEOS/3.6.2-foss-2018b-Python-3.7.0](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos)  GEOS (Geometry Engine
 - [GMP/6.1.2-GCCcore-7.3.0](http://gmplib.org/)  GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
 integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.

 - [GMP/6.1.1-foss-2016b](http://gmplib.org/)  GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, 
operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers. 
 - [HTSlib/1.9-foss-2018b](http://www.htslib.org/)  A C library for reading/writing high-throughput sequencing data.
 This package includes the utilities bgzip and tabix
 - [JAGS/4.2.0-foss-2016b](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)  JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis 
 of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation  
 - [SAMtools/1.9-foss-2018b](http://www.htslib.org/)  SAM Tools provide various utilities for manipulating alignments in the SAM format, 
 including sorting, merging, indexing and generating alignments in a per-position format.
