# Building X11 with EasyBuild

---
#### March 2nd, 2017

# Overview
EasyBuild version 3.0.1 supports a new package type for building X11. Easybuild
package X11-20160819-foss-2016b.eb is a single module with 71 componets
that make up X11.  The components of the X11 package are similar to
exts_list used by R and Python packages.

# Issue
There is a circular dependency between freetype and HarfBuzz. The latest 
freetype-2.6.5-foss-2016b.eb module from EasyBuild no longer has a dependency
on HarfBuzz. But the freetype executable will try to link HarfBuzz at
execution time. Breaking the cicular dependency between freetype and HarfBuzz
should help solve the issue of building X11.

But there is still a circular dependency between HarfBuzz, Cairo and X11.
Building Cairo with a modified version of X11 breaks the circular dependency.

# TODO
Try building GObject-Introspection package with-out cairo

Earlier versions of Cairo needs most of the X11 libraries, but Cairo does not 
need font support. Building X11 without libXft can be used to build Cairo.
After Cairo, HarfBuzz are built X11 can be rebuilt with libXft.
