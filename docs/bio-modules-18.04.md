 locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions. With these technologies, IDBA-UD
 can iterate k value of de Bruijn graph to a very large value with less gaps and less branches
 to form long contigs in both low-depth and high-depth regions.

Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technology that can reveal a lot about what happens in a group of cells as they develop. But because the technology destroys a cell, it can only provide snapshots of the cells in a group at one point in time. To really understand how cells develop over time, snapshots aren't good enough: scientists want to fill in the gaps between snapshots and string everything together into a movie.
