Fred Hutch maintains open source scientific software for use with HPC resouces at the center. This site provides an
inventory of available software and information about using scientific software. 

## Life Science Software Inventory
Inventory of module class "bio" software modules.  This is a subset of all modules that are available. The full
list of modules encompesses low level system libraries, math libraries, programming languages, visutilzation tools.

## Programming Languages
Scientific Computing maintains custom builds for R and Python. The
custom R and Python modules contain hundreds of packages. The package
list is a compilation of user requests.  Click on the links
bellow to see a list of available builds with a list of modules.

## Cluster Upgrade Project
In the Spring of 2019 the operating system on all High Performance Computing servers used at the
Fred Hutch will be upgraded. This upgrade will effect all the scientific software in use and require a rebuild
of the existing packages. The existing operating system is very out of date. As part of the upgrade the
toolchain that builds software will also be updated. The process of rebuilding the existing software enventory
has already started. This enventory list of new packages updating weekely, check often for updates.
