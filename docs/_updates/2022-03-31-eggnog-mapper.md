EggNOG-mapper is a tool for fast functional annotation of novel
sequences. It uses precomputed orthologous groups and phylogenies from the
eggNOG database (http://eggnog5.embl.de) to transfer functional information from
fine-grained orthologs only. Common uses of eggNOG-mapper include the annotation
of novel genomes, transcriptomes or even metagenomic gene catalogs.
