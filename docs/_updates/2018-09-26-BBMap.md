BBTools is a suite of fast, multithreaded bioinformatics tools designed for analysis of DNA and RNA sequence data. BBTools can handle common sequencing file formats such as fastq, fasta, sam, scarf, fasta+qual, compressed or raw, with autodetection of quality encoding and interleaving. The BBTools suite includes programs such as:
 * bbduk – filters or trims reads for adapters and contaminants using k-mers
 * bbmap – short-read aligner for DNA and RNA-seq data
 * bbmerge – merges overlapping or nonoverlapping pairs into a single reads
 * reformat – converts sequence files between different formats such as fastq and fasta
