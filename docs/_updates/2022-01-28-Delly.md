---
Delly is an integrated structural variant (SV) prediction
method that can discover, genotype and visualize deletions, tandem duplications,
inversions and translocations at single-nucleotide resolution in short-read
massively parallel sequencing data. It uses paired-ends, split-reads and
read-depth to sensitively and accurately delineate genomic rearrangements
throughout the genome.
