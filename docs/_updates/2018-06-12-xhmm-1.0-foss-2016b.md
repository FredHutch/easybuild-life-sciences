The XHMM (eXome-Hidden Markov Model) software suite calls copy number variation from next generation sequencing projects, where exome capture was used or targeted sequencing, more generally. Specifically, XHMM uses principal component analysis PCA normalization and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect and genotype copy number variation (CNV) from normalized read-depth data from targeted sequencing experiments.'
