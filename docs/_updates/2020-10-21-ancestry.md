### iAdmix: USING POPULATION ALLELE FREQUENCIES FOR COMPUTING INDIVIDUAL ADMIXTURE ESTIMATES:

Inference of ancestry is an important aspect of disease association studies as well as for understanding population history. We have developed a fast and accurate method for estimating the admixture proportions for an individual's ancestry using genotype or sequence data and population allele frequencies from a set of parental/reference populations.

The method is described in the paper: ["Fast individual ancestry inference from DNA sequence data leveraging allele frequencies from multiple populations".](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-014-0418-7)  Vikas Bansal and Ondrej Libiger. published in BMC Bioinformatics 2015.
