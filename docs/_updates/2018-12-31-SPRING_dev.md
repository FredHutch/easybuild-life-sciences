SPRING is a collection of pre-processing scripts and a web browser-based tool for visualizing and interacting with high dimensional data. View an example dataset here. SPRING was developed for single cell RNA-Seq data but can be applied more generally. The minimal input is a matrix of high dimensional data points (cells) and a list of dimension names (genes).
