DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification regulating several biological
 processes. A standard approach in the study of DNA methylation is bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq).
 MethGo is a simple and effective tool designed for the analysis of data from whole genome bisulfite
 sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).
