The Gurobi Optimizer allows users to state their toughest business problems as mathematical models, and then automatically considers billions or even trillions of possible solutions to find the best one. Our solver can be used as both a decision-making assistant, to help guide the choices of a skilled expert, or as a fully automated tool to make decisions with no human intervention.
