title: LoFreq-2.1.3.1
---
LoFreq is a fast and sensitive variant\-caller for inferring SNVs and indels from next\-generation sequencing data. It makes full use of base-call qualities and other sources of errors inherent in sequencing (e.g. mapping or base/indel alignment uncertainty), which are usually ignored by other methods or only used for filtering.
