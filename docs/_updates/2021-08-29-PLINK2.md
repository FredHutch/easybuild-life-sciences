PLINK2 is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to
 perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner.
 The focus of PLINK2 is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data.

#### Recent version history

- 26 Aug 2021: --pmerge-list concatenation-job detector no longer misses concatenation jobs where adjacent input files have same-position variants but those variants are always sorted by ID. --dummy can now generate phased data.

- 16 Aug: --parameters should now behave as described in the documentation when --glm is run with both the 'sex' and 'interaction' modifiers.

- 4 Aug: --update-sex now accepts 'U'/'u' as unknown-sex codes.

- 1 Jul: Fixed --bcf bug that could result in a spurious out-of-memory error when the file has no INFO entries.
