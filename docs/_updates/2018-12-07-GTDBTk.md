GTDB-Tk is a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes. It is computationally efficient and designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds or thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can also be applied to isolate and single-cell genomes.
