title: TRUST4-1.0.6
---
Tcr Receptor Utilities for Solid Tissue (TRUST) is a
computational tool to analyze TCR and BCR sequences using unselected RNA
sequencing data, profiled from solid tissues, including tumors. TRUST4 performs
de novo assembly on V, J, C genes including the hypervariable
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) and reports consensus of BCR/TCR
sequences. TRUST4 then realigns the contigs to IMGT reference gene sequences to
report the corresponding information. TRUST4 supports both single-end and
paired-end sequencing data with any read length.
