 - [DeepCell/0.11.1-foss-2021b-CUDA-11.4.1](https://deepcell.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
[easyconfig](https://github.com/FredHutch/easybuild-life-sciences/blob/master/easyconfigs/d/DeepCell/DeepCell-0.11.1-foss-2021b-CUDA-11.4.1.eb)
deepcell-tf is a deep learning library for single-cell analysis of biological
 images.This library allows users to apply pre-existing models to imaging data as well as to
 develop new deep learning models for single-cell analysis.
 - [Eigen/3.4.0-GCCcore-12.2.0](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers,
 and related algorithms.
 - [GEOS/3.9.1-GCC-11.2.0](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos)
GEOS (Geometry Engine
 - [GMP/6.2.1-GCCcore-12.2.0](https://gmplib.org/)
GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
 integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.

 - [MPC/1.3.1-GCCcore-12.3.0](http://www.multiprecision.org/)
Gnu Mpc is a C library for the arithmetic of
 complex numbers with arbitrarily high precision and correct
 rounding of the result. It extends the principles of the IEEE-754
 standard for fixed precision real floating point numbers to
 complex numbers, providing well-defined semantics for every
 operation. At the same time, speed of operation at high precision
 is a major design goal.
 - [MPFR/4.2.0-GCCcore-12.3.0](https://www.mpfr.org)
The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
 computations with correct rounding.

 - [PyTorch/2.1.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1](https://pytorch.org/)
[easyconfig](https://github.com/FredHutch/easybuild-life-sciences/blob/master/easyconfigs/p/PyTorch/PyTorch-2.1.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1.eb)
Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration.
PyTorch is a deep learning framework that puts Python first.
 - [Qhull/2020.2-GCCcore-11.2.0](http://www.qhull.org)
Qhull computes the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram,
 halfspace intersection about a point, furthest-site Delaunay triangulation,
 and furthest-site Voronoi diagram. The source code runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and
 higher dimensions. Qhull implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the
 convex hull.

 - [Shapely/1.8.2-foss-2021b](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely)
Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects.
It is based on the widely deployed GEOS (the engine of PostGIS) and JTS (from which GEOS is ported) libraries.
 - [gmpy2/2.1.5-GCC-12.3.0](https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy)
GMP/MPIR, MPFR, and MPC interface to Python 2.6+ and 3.x
 - [magma/2.7.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1](https://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/)
The MAGMA project aims to develop a dense linear algebra library similar to
 LAPACK but for heterogeneous/hybrid architectures, starting with current Multicore+GPU systems.
 - [sympy/1.12-gfbf-2023a](https://sympy.org/)
SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to
 become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as
 simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy
 is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
