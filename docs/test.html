    <h4> Fred Hutch Scientific Software</h4>
      <p>This repository contains the tools and recipes used to build software
      for the Fred Hutch. The Hutch uses Easybuild frame to buiand and manage
      software. Easybuild is a software build and installation framework for 
      managing scientific software. The user interface for using software is
      Modules.  The module command is used to instantiate a specific software
      package. Easybuild and Modules together provide a method to make
      repeatable and documented scientific software.
      </p>

    <h4>Software Packages</h4>
      <p>Easybuild modules are build from toolkits. The toolkit provides the
      foundation for system level and math libraries. Easybuild software modules
      names contain the software name-version and the toolkit name used to build
      the module. Custom reciepies used at the Hutch also have suffix ```fh``` 
      to distigue them from other published reciepeis. Once a reciepe is published
      to this repository it is not changed. If changes have to be made to a package
      the suffix is versioned. (fh1, fh2, fh3 etc).

    <h4>Using Modules</h4>
      <p>Modules can be loaded, unloaded, listed and searched.  The 
      <tt>module load</tt> can be abrivated to <tt>ml</tt>.
      <ul>
         <li>ml Python/3.6.5-foss-2016b-fh1  \# load a module</li>
         <li>ml  \# list currently loaded modules</li>
         <li>ml purge \# Unload all modules</li>
         <li>ml avail Python  \# Show all available Python modules</li>
      </ul>
