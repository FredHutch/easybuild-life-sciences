This is a rewrite of DSSP, now offering full mmCIF support. The difference with

category.

Another new feature in this version of DSSP is that it now defines Poly-Proline
helices as well.

The DSSP program was designed by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris Sander to standardize
secondary structure assignment. DSSP is a database of secondary structure
assignments (and much more) for all protein entries in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB). DSSP is also the program that calculates DSSP entries from PDB entries.

DSSP does not predict secondary structure.

      development or to use special resources of remote machines.

    * --looponfail: run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess. After
        each run pytest waits until a file in your project changes and
        then re-runs the previously failing tests. This is repeated
        until all tests pass after which again a full run is
        performed.

    * Multi-Platform coverage: you can specify different Python
      interpreters or different platforms and run tests in parallel on
      all of them.

Before running tests remotely, pytest efficiently “rsyncs” your
program source code to the remote place. All test results are reported
back and displayed to your local terminal. You may specify different
Python versions and interpreters.
