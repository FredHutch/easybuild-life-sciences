VDJtools is an open-source Java/Groovy-based framework
designed to facilitate analysis of immune repertoire sequencing (RepSeq)
data. VDJtools computes a wide set of statistics and is able to perform
various forms of cross-sample analysis.

The wham suite consists of two programs, wham and whamg. wham, the original tool, is a very sensitive method with a high false discovery rate. The second program, whamg, is more accurate and better suited for general structural variant (SV) discovery.

The XHMM (eXome-Hidden Markov Model) C++ software suite calls copy number variation (CNV) from next-generation sequencing projects, where exome capture was used (or targeted sequencing, more generally). Specifically, XHMM uses principal component analysis (PCA) normalization and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect and genotype copy number variation (CNV) from normalized read-depth data from targeted sequencing experiments.
