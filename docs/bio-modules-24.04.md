 - [GMP/6.3.0-GCCcore-13.2.0](https://gmplib.org/)
GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
 integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.

 - [HH-suite/3.3.0-gompi-2023a](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite)
The HH-suite is an open-source software package
 for sensitive protein sequence searching based on the pairwise
 alignment of hidden Markov models (HMMs).
 - [HMMER/3.4-gompi-2023a](http://hmmer.org/)
HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs
 of protein sequences, and for making protein sequence alignments. It
 implements methods using probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov
 models (profile HMMs).  Compared to BLAST, FASTA, and other sequence
 alignment and database search tools based on older scoring methodology,
 HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and more able to detect remote
 homologs because of the strength of its underlying mathematical models. In the
 past, this strength came at significant computational expense, but in the new
 HMMER3 project, HMMER is now essentially as fast as BLAST.
 - [HTSlib/1.19.1-GCC-13.2.0](https://www.htslib.org/)
[easyconfig](https://github.com/FredHutch/easybuild-life-sciences/blob/master/fh_easyconfigs/h/HTSlib/HTSlib-1.19.1-GCC-13.2.0.eb)

Kalign is a fast multiple sequence alignment program for biological sequences.
 - [MPC/1.3.1-GCCcore-12.3.0](http://www.multiprecision.org/)
Gnu Mpc is a C library for the arithmetic of
 complex numbers with arbitrarily high precision and correct
 rounding of the result. It extends the principles of the IEEE-754
 standard for fixed precision real floating point numbers to
 complex numbers, providing well-defined semantics for every
 operation. At the same time, speed of operation at high precision
 is a major design goal.
 - [MPFR/4.2.1-GCCcore-13.2.0](https://www.mpfr.org)
The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
 computations with correct rounding.

 - [OpenMM/8.0.0-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1](https://openmm.org)
