title: AGFusion (Annotate Gene Fusion)
catagory: lang
---
AGFusion is a python package for annotating gene fusions from the human or mouse genomes. AGFusion simply needs the reference genome, the two gene partners, and the fusion junction coordinates as input, and outputs the following:
* FASTA files of cDNA, CDS, and protein sequences.
* Visualizes the protein domain and exon architectures of the fusion transcripts.
* Saves tables listing the coordinates of protein features and exons included in the fusion.
* Optional exon structure and protein domain visualization of the wild-type version of the fusion gene partners.
