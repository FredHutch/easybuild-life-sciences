Beginning with R-3.5.1 there are packages for each release of R. A community
 release and a Fred Hutch release. The community release is based on the
 EasyBuild R. The Fred Hutch build is based on the EasyBuild release plus 
 addition packages that have been requested by Fred Hutch staff.  Fred Hutch
 R modules use the -fh1 suffix.
