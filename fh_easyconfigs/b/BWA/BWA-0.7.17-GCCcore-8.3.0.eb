description = """BWA is a software package for mapping DNA sequences against a large reference genome,
 such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The
 first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer
 sequences ranged from 70bp to a few megabases. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as the
 support of long reads and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally
 recommended as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack
 for 70-100bp Illumina reads."""
