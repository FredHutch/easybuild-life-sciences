Building RevBays 1.1.1 - March 2021

first attempts was with full foss/2020b, but switch to GCC/10.2.0 which eliminates MPI.
FYI - Boost/1.74-GCC-10.2.0 does not have MPI


Add libnpth0 the GNU Pthread library. This passes for Pthread and POSIX compliant threads. libnpth0 is on all the cluster nodes
but not the Docker build container.  With Ubuntu using -lpthread will only catch about 80 of the libraries? Very strange,
but using C_FLAGS=-pthread will catch all the pthread libriries. Again, not an issue with CENTOS.

There is no "pthread" library for Bionic.
add -pthread to CXX flag

This error was fixed by adding this CMake flag: -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON'
Which I read about here:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081084/target-boostlibrary-already-has-an-imported-location-link-errors
which id due to a bug in Boost/1.71.0 See https://github.com/boostorg/boost_install/issues/13, it should be fixed in the next release.

This CMake directive should have worked but did not:  set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED TRUE)
