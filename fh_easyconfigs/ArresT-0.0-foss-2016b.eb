 a deep understanding of antigen receptor sequences with a cascade of 
 algorithms and databases. ARResT, in some form or other over the years, is
 behind all of our publications in the field, and will continue to be in the
 foreseeable future. It is under constant development by and hosted at the
 Bioinformatics Analysis Team / BAT (i.e. us) and many colleagues and
 collaborators, including the EuroClonality-NGS (EC-NGS) consortium on
 Next-Generation Sequencing for IG / TR immunoprofiling."""
